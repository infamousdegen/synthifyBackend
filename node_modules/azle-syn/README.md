# azle-syn

Originally forked from https://github.com/RReverser/astexplorer-syn.

```bash
wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

Take the azle_syn_bg.wasm, azle_syn_bg.wasm.d.ts, and azle_syn.d.ts files and copy them into the typescript directory. azle_syn.js is modified from the original wasm-pack ouptut to work with Azle and should not be modified.
